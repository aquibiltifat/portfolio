        <h2 class="chapter-title">The Foundation: The Spark of "Why?"</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="chapter-subtitle">A Journey — of knowing who we are, why we believe, and how it is all interconnected.</p>
      
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>My intellectual journey began not within the four walls of a formal university, but in my mother's lap and the intimate atmosphere of a home, where my relentless curiosity-filled mind was shaped by emotional stability and spiritual discipline, and trained to undertake the journey of knowing the reality of things by establishing questions.</p>
        
        <p>My questions began with the physical world— "Why is the color of the sky blue? Who created the sky?" — then they moved towards ethical dilemmas— "What is the standard of right and wrong? Is right right for everyone and wrong wrong for everyone?" — and finally transformed into existential concerns: "Where do we stand in this vast universe? Does our existence have a purpose in this whole cosmos? If so, what is it, and how is that purpose to be achieved?"</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>It was my mother who provided an epistemological framework to this curiosity of mine. She taught that 'Ilm' (knowledge) which is acquired to benefit people is in itself an 'Ibadat' (worship).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This principle was imprinted in my mind when I first heard the Hadith, which became the academic tenet of my life:</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>"Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave." (Hadith - This hadith is very famous but weak (da'eef) in authenticity)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This was not just an instruction; it was a spiritual mandate for lifelong learning.</p>
        
        <p>Upon this foundation rested my first intellectual liberation: the understanding that asking questions is not Kufr (blasphemy), but a means of reaching the higher stages of Iman (faith). My faith did not stifle my reason, but rather encouraged it. After all, the divine imperative that was revealed was 'Iqra' (Read):</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>"Read in the name of your Lord who created." (Qur'an 96:1)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This ended any supposed conflict between knowledge and faith before it could begin.</p>
        
        <p>My maternal grandfather made this theoretical foundation practical. He would take me to the Mosque to offer Fajr (the morning prayer), and on the way back would turn the pages of history— sometimes the narrative of Karbala, which was a lesson in sacrifice and moral courage, and sometimes the event of Hijrah, which was a sociological study of strategy and community-building. It was there that I learned that history is not merely a compilation of past dates, but 'Tarbiyyah' — that is, the inner refinement and ethical training of the personality.</p>
        
        <p>Those gatherings at home— where there was the emotional commemoration of Milad un Nabi صلى الله عليه وسلم, where the high character and teachings of the Last Prophet of Allah, Hazrat Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, were discussed, where there was dialogue on Qur'an and Hadith— were informal seminars for me. It was in these discussions that the first spark of 'Fikr' — meaning deep reflection and critical thinking — was ignited within me.</p>
        
        <p>This dual training gave a distinct dimension to my thinking. Science gave me an understanding of 'how' (the mechanism), while Religion asked me the question of 'why' (the teleology). The confluence of these two became a continuous question in my mind, which still drives my journey today: "Is there a purpose behind everything— if yes, then what is that purpose (Telos)?"</p>

      <div class="chapter-header">
        <div class="chapter-number">2</div>
        <h2 class="chapter-title">The Framework: The Lens of the Past</h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>As I grew older, that fire of "why" deepened. I realized — to understand today, it is essential to know yesterday. Nations that are oblivious to their past also have their future in darkness.</p>
        
        <p>For me, history was not just the dates of kings — it was the book of human experience. My early worldview was shaped through spiritual upbringing and foundational Islamic concepts. But as my curiosity matured, I felt the need to understand how earlier Muslim scholars had systematized knowledge, society, and morality. This naturally led me into the deeper intellectual tradition of Islamic philosophy, where thinkers like Ibn Khaldun, Al-Ghazali, and others offered complete frameworks to connect faith, reason, and human behavior.</p>
        
        <p>I read Ibn Khaldun, whose Al-Muqaddimah taught that society is like a living organism — which is born on 'Asabiyyah' (social cohesion), grows, and then becomes decadent. This gave me a cyclical view of the rise and fall of nations.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>If we study the Qur'an, in Surah Al-Imran (Chapter 3), verse 140: "And such are the days—We rotate them among mankind."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In this verse, the concept of rotation directly confirms Ibn Khaldun's "cyclical view". It is the law of Allah (which is also called Sunnatullah) that power and rule do not remain with any one nation or group forever.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, Al-Ghazali in his Ihya' 'Ulum al-Din (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) explained what the relationship between Reason and Soul should be.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>His view was: "The purpose of knowledge is not to argue, but to transform the self."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This is the central point of Imam Al-Ghazali's philosophy. His entire project is based on the idea that the purpose of Ilm (knowledge) is not mere academic debate (Jadal) or intellectual arrogance, but the refinement of the soul (Tazkiyat al-Nafs) and achieving the true Gnosis (Ma'rifat) of Allah, which changes a person's Amal (action) and Akhlaq (character).</p>
        
        <p>Exploring both Western and Islamic intellectual traditions shaped a worldview that was neither borrowed nor inherited, but consciously constructed. However, ideas alone were no longer enough. I needed to see how these philosophies operated in the real world—through institutions, laws, and human systems. This realization shifted my journey from pure thought to structured learning.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">The Blueprint: The Rules of the Present — LLB & Geopolitics</h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The real test of knowledge is in understanding and improving the 'Systems' of the practical world. Therefore, my next intellectual destination rested on the rules and laws of the present.</p>
        
        <h3>Law: The Blueprint of Society</h3>
        <p>Once I understood the intellectual architecture behind civilizations—through the Qur'an, Ibn Khaldun, Aristotle, Machiavelli, and others—it became clear that law is where philosophical ideas take concrete form. This insight made me turn toward formal legal education.</p>
        
        <p>I began my studies in LLB. Law is not merely rules written in books, but the 'blueprint' of society's collective thought, morality, and necessity.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>Inspired by Imam Abu Hanifa's 'Hypothetical Fiqh', I learned how to adapt rules for changing times.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The principle of Maqasid (Purpose) of Imam Al-Shatibi gave a moral soul to my legal thinking: The 'body' (Rules) of the law must be subordinate to its 'soul' (Purpose).</p>
        
        <h3>Geopolitics: The Mirror of Power</h3>
        <p>The study of Law drew me towards Geopolitics— the intersection where the currents of history, Power Politics, economics, and international law collide.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>Machiavelli's The Prince made me face a harsh reality: the world is not 'as it ought to be' (idealism), but 'as it is' (realism).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This practical study solidified my spiritual knowledge: "And such are the days — We rotate them among mankind." is an Eternal Truth of the cyclical law of power and trials.</p>
        
        <p>In this way, LLB and Geopolitics gave me a 'blueprint' that turned my 'Fikr' (deep reflection) towards 'Amal' (Action).</p>

      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>The true purpose of knowledge is fulfilled when it ceases to be just a mental exercise and becomes an Action that improves human life.</p>
        
        <h3>My Career: The Microcosm of the Global System</h3>
        <p>My job as a US IT Recruiter, at first glance, seems separate from my studies, but it is actually a microcosm of my study of Geopolitics and cyclical history. I see how technology, law (especially inspired by Imam Abu Hanifa's 'Hypothetical Fiqh'), and human resources are interconnected in a complex global system. I see the balance of labour, capital, and power being determined every day (which reflects Ibn Khaldun's Asabiyyah and the Qur'an's nudāwiluhā principle in a modern form). This is an everyday example of Machiavelli's 'Realism'— that the system works 'as it is,' rather than 'as it ought to be'.</p>
        
        <h3>MERCI Foundation: The Soul of Maqasid</h3>
        <p>On the other hand, MERCI Foundation is the center for turning my 'Ilm' (Knowledge) into 'Amal' (Action).</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>This is the place that receives spiritual strength from the Maqasid al-Shari'ah (The Purposes of Law) of Imam Al-Shatibi.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Our work is not just charity; it directly fulfills the Five Basic Purposes of the Shari'ah— Hifazat-e-Nafs (Protection of Life), Hifazat-e-Aql (Protection of Intellect - free courses), and Hifazat-e-Maal (Protection of Wealth - making people capable of earning).</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>This is the worship, this is the faith and religion,<br>
          That man is useful to man in the world.<br>
          - Altaf Husain Hali</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This is the field where Imam Al-Ghazali's principle— "The purpose of knowledge is not to argue, but to transform the self"— comes alive.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">The Synthesis: The Intellectual Hub of Thought and Action</h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="chapter-content">
        <p>When I look at the five chapters of this journey together, it becomes not merely a biography, but a complete symbol of soul, thought, and action.</p>
        
        <h3>The Core of the Journey: Four Pillars</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The spark of 'Why':</strong> From Chapter 1 and the principle 'Ilm' is Ibadat, is the fire of 'Fikr' (deep reflection) within me that has never been extinguished.</li>
          <li><strong>The Lens of the Past:</strong> Gave me 'Fikr' a framework of History and Philosophy. Ibn Khaldun's cyclical view and the Qur'an's injunction commands us to learn from decline and move forward, became the core of my intellectual consciousness.</li>
          <li><strong>The Rules of the Present:</strong> Gave me the 'blueprint' to understand the complex system of the present. Machiavelli's Realism taught me to see the world 'as it is', but Imam Shatibi's Maqasid al-Shari'ah gave a moral soul to this 'blueprint'.</li>
          <li><strong>The Laboratory of Action:</strong> Turned this entire theoretical knowledge into 'Amal' (Action). My job became the microcosm of the global power game, where MERCI Foundation made the Maqasid a ground reality.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>Thus, Imam Al-Ghazali's principle— "The purpose of knowledge is not to argue, but to transform the self"— became the core mantra of my social work.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Conclusion: From Self-Awareness to The Truth</h3>
        <p>The final outcome of my journey is a Synthesis, where Iqbal's 'Khudi' (self-identity) has found the path of 'Amal' through the Maqasid al-Shari'ah. History gave me roots, Philosophy gave me wings, and Law gave me balance.</p>
        
        <p>With this very conviction, I started Edumots and my website— a platform that is not just a 'center of knowledge' for me, but a 'bridge of action'; where theoretical knowledge and practical solutions dialogue with each other.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>"We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it is the Truth." (Qur'an 41:53)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>I am still in search of that same "Why", but now I understand that behind every "Why" there is a "Who" — and that "Who" is Al-Haqq (The Truth).</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          <p>"There are still more worlds beyond the stars,<br>
          There are still more trials of love to pass."<br>
